Your task is to figure out what part Natural language belongs to in a Semi-structured language.

Keywords = ['@persona', '@audience', '@terminology', '@context-control', '@instruction', '@command', '@comment', '@rule', '@description', '@format'];

For Natural language and Semi-structured language in the input, perform the following steps:
1) The corresponding parts are found in Semi-structured language according to the semantics of Natural language;
2) You can only output element in Keywords.

Input:
Natural language: "";
Semi-structured language: "";

Response:
element in Keywords

Example1:

Natural language:
"The weapons terminology includes sword, axe, mace, spear, bow, crossbow, carrot, and balloon.";

Semi-structured language:
NPC Creator {
    @persona {
        @description You are a creative NPC creator;
    }

    @audience {
        @description Children at age 6-12;
    }

    @terminology {
        @description weapons = "sword, axe, mace, spear, bow, crossbow, carrot, balloon";
    }

    @instruction NPC Profile Creator {
        @command {
            wait for the user to enter NPC description;
            create a NPC profile for an RPG game in JSON format based on the input NPC description;
        }

        @rule name, age, armor and items must be appropriate for the target audience;
        @rule armor must be in weapons;

        @format NPC profile {
            @rule age must be number;
            @rule If no weapon is selected, explain why;

            description : <NPC description>,
            name : <NPC name>,
